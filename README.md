According to INDIAN EXPRESS , "Every day 12,000 people in India die due to the sheer lack of donated blood and many people die due to non availability of blood donors at right time . 
India collects 11 million units of blood but needs 15 million units,thereâ€™s a deficit of 4 million units.So,BloodBuddy presents a solution by providing itself as a 
notification system for individuals, NGOs and hospitals in case of any blood type shortage.Users and medical facilities including blood donation camps can notify 
on the portal for any need.The requirements are projected as a slide over the concerned location on google maps API. It can also keeps its users aware by publishing ariticles
on diffrent medical issues.It can also integrate smart health devices like blood oxymeter, smart blood pressure monitoring or any smart body sensorand provides some insights over the 
data.On a maps api, hospitals have their column for notifications and blood donation camps can be spotted easier and a potential donor can be found in case of dire need.
On the whole, it can function as a health app spreading awareness on health and makes the donation process of blood donation easier for this generation of tech.
  

Talking of business, hospitals,NGOs and donation camp organisation can be charged a fee for being able to post their inventory info  or requirements to be visible to people.


Firebase Authorization is integrated and a bottom navigation bar is used with three fragments, icons are from flaticon,due to some android resource linking failure error an apk
could not be built(considering this app was built by only a person from the ground up and idea of my teammate, I could not include the jetpack libraries or implement any material.io. or mlkit)
Also a piece of this app's working code is on my github as my first repo
